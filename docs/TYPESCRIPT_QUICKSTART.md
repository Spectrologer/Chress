# TypeScript Quick Start

## What Was Done

Your project has been set up for **incremental TypeScript migration**. You can now:
- Add type checking to JavaScript files without converting them to TypeScript
- Get IntelliSense and autocomplete in your editor
- Catch type errors before runtime

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check types across the project
npm run type-check

# Watch mode - checks types as you code
npm run type-check:watch
```

## How to Add Types to a File

### 1. Add `@ts-check` at the top
```javascript
// @ts-check
// rest of your file...
```

### 2. Add JSDoc type comments
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} name - User's name
 * @param {number} age - User's age
 * @returns {boolean} Whether user is valid
 */
function validateUser(name, age) {
    return name.length > 0 && age >= 0;
}
```

### 3. Define object types
```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {Object} User
 * @property {string} id - Unique ID
 * @property {string} name - User's name
 * @property {number} age - User's age
 */

/** @type {User[]} */
const users = [];
```

## Example: `tools/asset-scanner.js`

This file has been fully typed as an example. Open it to see how JSDoc types work in practice.

- Common patterns and examples
- Best practices
- Recommended migration order

## Benefits You Get Right Now

✅ **Better autocomplete** - Your editor knows what properties exist
✅ **Error catching** - Typos and type mismatches caught immediately
✅ **Documentation** - Types serve as inline documentation
✅ **Refactoring safety** - Rename and move code with confidence
✅ **Zero runtime cost** - It's all compile-time checking

## No Pressure!

You can:
- Leave files as plain JavaScript (they'll still work)
- Add types gradually, file by file
- Focus on high-value areas first
- Use types as much or as little as you want

The setup is complete and ready when you are!
