/**
 * EnemyAttackMixin - Special attack patterns for advanced enemy types.
 *
 * Provides attack abilities for enemies with extended range:
 * - Ram attacks: Charge from distance with knockback (lizardeaux, zard, lazerd)
 * - Queen charges: Multi-directional charge attacks (lazerd)
 * - Line-of-sight validation: Ensure clear path before attacking
 *
 * Attack Types:
 * 1. Ram (Rook/Bishop): Charge along straight line, knock player back
 * 2. Queen Charge: Move diagonally + orthogonally, then attack
 *
 * These abilities make advanced enemies more dangerous and tactical.

     * Executes a ram attack from distance with line-of-sight validation.
     * Enemy charges toward player along a straight line and delivers knockback.
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Validate line-of-sight:
     *    a. Check if player is on straight line (orthogonal or diagonal)
     *    b. Verify no obstacles between enemy and player
     *    c. Ensure no other enemies blocking path
     * 2. Calculate charge path and animation steps
     * 3. Generate smoke trail along charge path
     * 4. Calculate knockback direction (continues charge momentum)
     * 5. Execute attack with knockback
     *
     * Movement Restrictions:
     * - lizardeaux: Orthogonal only (rook-like) - diagonal rams blocked
     * - zard: Diagonal only (bishop-like)
     * - lazerd: Any direction (queen-like)
     *
     * Line-of-Sight:
     * - Must have clear path (walkable tiles)
     * - Other enemies block line-of-sight
     * - Player position (endpoint) not checked for walkability
     *
     * Knockback:
     * - Direction matches charge direction
     * - Player pushed 1 tile away from enemy
     * - If no valid knockback position, player stays in place
     *
     * @param {Player} player - The player being attacked
