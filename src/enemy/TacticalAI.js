/**
 * Tactical AI system for cooperative enemy behavior and movement optimization.
 *
 * This system enables enemies to make intelligent tactical decisions by:
 * - Avoiding clustering in the same direction (flanking behavior)
 * - Maintaining cooperative formations
 * - Making defensive decisions when threatened
 * - Preventing stacking that blocks allies
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Ally Distance: How close enemies are to each other (clustering metric)
 * - Direction Diversity: Distribution of enemies around the player (prevents grouping)
 * - Stacking: When enemies align in a line toward the player (inefficient positioning)
 * - Defensive Moves: Retreating when threatened to increase survival
